# PixelFed Data Modeling
## Project Overview:
Pxelfed is an image sharing platform. Think of it as a decentralised version of instagram for sharing photos, with emphasis on privacy and security. You have been hired to model their data warehouse from a scratch. Since they are a startup at this point in time, and since you are the first member of the data team, you are asked to model the data warehouse the best you can. They describe their bussiness processes and the insights they care about as "that of your usual social media platform".

## Resources:

-	Generate DDL scripts for creation of the data warehouse.
    
## Key Deliverables:
